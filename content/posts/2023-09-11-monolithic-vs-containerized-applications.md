Nowadays, for developing applications, there are the following two major approaches (apart from these also approaches are there):

- Monolithic Architecture (Monolith)
- Microservice Architecture (Containerized)

What are these two developing approaches? How to decide which one is for you?

## What is monolithic architecture ?

Monolithic architecture (Monolith) generally means developing an application which is tightly coupled meaning the frontend, backend and configuration that is required by the application to run is all present in one codebase. For example consider developing an E-Commerce website, it will have several components in the website like the frontend (UI of the website), the backend, also many services like fetching list of products, users, orders, making payments, analyzing services etc. All of these components will be present in a singular codebase.

### Pros

- **Lesser learning curve:** Applications built using monolithic architecture are easier to get built since for development you don’t need much know-how. This might be a good option for startups and individuals who don’t want to spend much time gaining knowledge on microservices and just want to get the application up and running.
- **Quicker to develop:** Since the monolithic-based applications have a single codebase it is much quicker to get up and running as compared to going with the microservice-based approach.

### Cons

- **Difficulty in scaling:** Being one codebase if we want to scale the application we have no choice but to scale the entire application even if we just want to scale any specific component.
- **Resilience:** In a monolithic-based application if something goes wrong the entire application goes down. This is not an ideal solution if you want your application to be highly available.
- **Cost:** This might be an important factor for many individuals, but since the codebase is a single entity scaling the application would mean scaling the entire application so cost might increase as compared to the microservice architecture.

## **What is Microservice Architecture?**

Microservice architecture involves having the application code divided into different components each handling (ideally) only one function. If we take the same example of a website we can have the frontend of the website as a microservice, backend as a separate microservice, etc. All of these microservices need to be independent of each other and can also be developed using different languages or frameworks.

### Pros

- **Scalability:** Since the application is divided into separate services, if we want to scale just a specific service or component of the application we can do that. This provides flexibility as well as reduces the cost of deployment.
- **Resilience:** In case something goes wrong with the application, only the particular service that is affected will go down apart from that the application will still be available.
- **Flexibility:** Having segregated applications into containers gives developers more flexibility to choose the technology for developing each service.
- **Cost:** Having an application deployed in microservice architecture gives us the flexibility to scale just the parts we need and keep the other parts of the application untouched. This can reduce the cost of having the application deployed as compared to monolithic applications.

### Cons

- **Steeper learning curve:** Turning your entire application to microservices requires some insight into containerization and the technologies that might be used to deploy the containers majorly docker, containerd, etc. These technologies take a while to learn by the developers and can increase the time taken for development and deployment.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Having a microservice-based application can be much more difficult to test as well as debug since the application will have many microservices; so pointing out the exact issue of what went wrong can be tricky.

## Monolithic Architecture VS Microservices Architecture

|  | Monolithic Architecture | Microservice Architecture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Complexity to use | Easy to get up and running | Requires more technical knowledge |
| Scalability | Difficult to scale | Easier to scale |
| Resilience | Less resilient | More resilient |
| Cost | More deployment cost | Lower deployment cost |
| Technology Usage | Difficult to change technology used | Different microservices can have different technologies used |

## How to choose between the monolithic and microservice architecture?

Both architectures for building applications have their own place. For deciding on the architecture keep in mind the following points:

- **Application Complexity:** Application complexity plays a significant role in deciding the architecture you want to go for. If the application is relatively simple and small going with the monolithic architecture might be a good choice; on the other hand, if the app is complex and has a lot of moving parts it's better to stick with the microservice-based architecture due to its benefits.
- **Team Size:** If the team is small and doesn’t have experience working with microservice-based applications then going with the microservice-based approach might be a bad decision. If the team has some experience working with microservice-based applications then it might be a good choice to go with the microservice approach.
- **Time to develop:** As you might have guessed since we have all components tightly coupled in a monolith application it will take less time to develop, test, and deploy the app compared to a more complex loosely coupled microservice approach.
